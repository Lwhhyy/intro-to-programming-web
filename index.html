    <h1>Wing Hey's Website</h1>
    <h2>This is all about me</h2>
    <h3>Don't be too surprised</h3>
    <br>
    <p>I am Wing Hey and this is my first html website I created in my Intro to Programming class. I am a CWP 5th semester student here at Berklee and I am a voice principal. I am from Hong Kong so I am really not used to the <b>COLD</b> weather here in Boston. However I still enjoy my time with friends I met here!</p>
    Things I like to do:
    <ul>
        <li>trying new desserts</li>
        <li>writing journals</li>
        <li>trying new outfits</li>
    </ul>
